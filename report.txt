# Short Report — Survival Analysis 


Using parametric AFT models (Weibull, Log-normal, Log-logistic) we studied factors associated with customer churn.
After preprocessing and model comparison by AIC, the best-fitting model indicates that features such as age, income, and length of residence (address) have significant associations with survival time.
Positive coefficients in the AFT framework indicate longer expected tenure while negative coefficients shorten expected tenure.
For example, higher income and longer tenure-related variables increase survival probabilities, suggesting these customers are less likely to churn.


I define "valuable" customers as those with high predicted 12-month CLV and high survival probability.
In practice these are customers with higher monthly revenue and lower predicted churn risk. 
Using the final model, I computed CLV for each subscriber and identified segments with the highest average CLV. 
Assuming the dataset represents the population, an annual retention budget could be estimated by summing the CLV of customers whose predicted 12-month survival probability falls below a chosen threshold and targeting offers up to their CLV to retain them.
